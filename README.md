### Hello world!

#### About me
- 😔 I'm a french guy spending too much time breaking things he shouldn't.
- 🔒 I'm particularly interested in InfoSec and AI topics.

I don't have any degree, I'm just really curious about all sorts of things.

#### Contact me
- 🔑 You can contact me using my PGP key ([ed25519](https://cloud.targaryen.house/s/XsFjcfJezANBq5K)/[RSA](https://cloud.targaryen.house/s/4ndbeKmoo8sEjDz)).
- 💬 I'm also available at Matrix: `wonderfall:targaryen.house`.

Keep in mind I may be slow to respond!

#### Languages
- 🐍 I mainly write stuff in Python.
- 🦀 And I'm actively learning Rust!

I also have experience in other languages (such as Swift) but I don't see the point in listing every language I tried. These are the **languages I currently use** for my personal projects & stuff. If I need a new stack, then I'll just learn it.

#### SysAdmin
- 🐳 I'm a container guy. I love Docker (and other OCI stuff) & gVisor.

Well, I guess that's a bit obvious since I made tons of Dockerfiles over the years.

*Thanks for passing by!*
